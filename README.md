# newGitTest
This is my first GitHub repository... A message to my future self: "I have no idea where life will take you in the future, but I hope it's great. Also don't forget everyone has a beginning, I hope you don't forget yours! Don't be lazy! Don't loose motivation! DO be a go-getter and DO stay passionate.""
